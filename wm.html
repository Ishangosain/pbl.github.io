               <p><font size="5"> Step 1: Prep Washing Machine:- 
                   Use warm soapy water to clean inside and
                outside of washing machine. Remove any plastic parts. 
                Our plastic rim was easily removed after pulling two screws off that attached it at the rim.</font></p>
                
                <p><font size="5">Step 2: Hammer Down Rim:-
                     Use metal mallet to pound rim and fold down any
                     sharp parts. Do this to any area where the metal is jagged.</font></p>
                     <p><font size="5">Step 3: Tape Off Pattern:-
                          Use painters tape to mark off diagonal 
                         pattern on drum. Our pattern has 5 white and 5 silver stripes. Start at the top and
                          angle down to the very bottom. Use the holes in the drum to help guide your lines. 
                          Do not like stripes? Use a stencil to create a fun pattern.</font></p>
                
                <p><font size="5">Step 4: Paint Drum:- 
                    Spray entire outside of drum with high heat silver spray
                     paint. This spray paint comes in limited colors at the hardware store and multiple colors
                      online. Be aware that the paint will bubble and fade after a few hot fires in the drum so
                       you may want to refresh.</font></p>
                
                       <p><font size="5">Step 5: Paint Piping:-
                
                While the drum is drying, lay out all of the iron pipes and fittings on a tarp. 
                Paint them with high heat spray paint as well. Make sure you clean the pipes thoroughly 
                before painting.</font></p>
                
                <p><font size="5">Step 6: Remove Painterâ€™s Tape:-
                
                While piping is drying, remove the painter tape on drum to reveal the diagonal stripes.</font></p>
                
                <p><font size="5">Step 7: Assemble Legs:-
                
                Add cap to 18 cm pipe, then attach pipe to elbow. Attach elbow to flange to form the leg. 
                These fittings need to not only be tight, but also line up correctly to allow the leg to
                 stand up straight. This is why we assembled the entire leg first and then attached to the drum.</font></p>
                
                 <p><font size="5">Step 8: Attach Legs to Drum:- 
                     Tilt drum on side to attach first leg. Line up flange holes with holes in drum. Place machine
                 screws through hole in flange. We used stainless steel hardware, which can take the heat of 
                 the fire.</font></p>
                
                 <p><font size="5">Step 9: Secure Legs:- 
                Place wing nuts on back of screw on inside of the drum. Once all four legs are attached, 
                the drum will stand up on its own.</font></p>
                
                <p><font size="5">Step 10: Place On Pavers:-
                The firepit should be placed in a heat-safe setting. Fill the drum with logs. Light and enjoy!
