        <p><font size="5"> 1)Gathering materials:-We need six CDs (or just a CD box ), a soldering iron and a small
             lamp that will fit in our CD box. The lamp have to be not too small, because it would go out of 
             the CD box.</font></p>
             <p><font size="5"> 2)Making of whole thing:- A. If you don't have a CD box
                The construction is very easy. You have to place the cd's at 90 degree angle, and then you 
                have to make little holes between them using hot soldering iron. Now if the "standing" cd
                 won't fall, it means you can add third one (just the same way you attached the previous two 
                 CD's to each other). If it looks like the (3 CDs) construction on photo, repeat what whole
                  thing to have two CD corners(made of three CDs). Now we have to put the lamp between those 
                  two corners, and then connect corners just to make a CD box.</font></p>
                 <p><font size="5"> B. If you do have a CD box then we have to unattach one CD of the box, put the lamp inside 
                and then use soldering iron to put the CD back to its place. </font></p>
                <p><font size="5">3) Light your room with your cd lamp:- Now you can light the room with your lamp. It looks kickass especially in night.I hope you enjoyed my 
                instructable. Caution:- Keep in your mind that the lamp can melt CDs from the heat generated
                 by lamp.</font></p>
