            <p><font size="5">      Appliance recycling is the process of dismantling waste home appliances and scrapping 
                            their parts for reuse. Recycling appliances for their original or other purposes, involves
                            disassembly,removal of hazardous components and destruction of the equipment to recover materials,
                            generally by shredding, sorting and grading.The rate at which appliances are discarded
                            has increased with technological advancement. This correlation directly leads to the question of 
                            appropriate disposal. The main types of appliances that are recycled are televisions, refrigerators,
                            air conditioners, washing machines, and computers. When appliances are recycled, they can be looked 
                            upon as valuable resources. If disposed of improperly, appliances can become environmentally harmful
                            and poison ecosystems.</font> </p>

                                            <p><font size="5">1. LARGE SAVINGS OF CARBON DIOXIDE:-
                                                Electronics recycling creates major positive environmental 
                                                effects. Our recycling of electronics from you and other
                                                 customers helps to avoid more than 1.3 million tonnes of 
                                                 carbon dioxide emissions each year. This equals 200,000 
                                                  flights around the world. This would have been the negative
                                                  impact if the same amount was produced from new natural 
                                                  resources and if the climate damaging gases from cooling
                                                   appliances had not been processed in our closed system.</p>
                                             <p>2. ENERGY SAVING:-
                                                Recycling 1 kg of plastic conserves enough energy to power a vacuum cleaner for 34 hours.
                                                Recycling of one mobile phone conserves energy enough to have 
                                                a 9 W lamp lit for 206 days.</p>   
                                            <p>3. SAVES MONEY:-
                                                If you chose to dispose of old appliances at your local landfill,
                                                 you will have to pay a disposal fee whereas if you were to recycle 
                                                 old appliances, you won’t have to pay a disposal fee and might even
                                                  make a little money depending on the condition of the steel, 
                                                  aluminum, and metal of your appliance.</p> 
                                            <p>4. PROTECTS THE OZONE LAYER:-
                                                Cooling appliances, such as air conditioners, rely on the cooling
                                                 agent Freon to work properly. When these appliances are disposed of,                                                 
                                                 the Freon isn’t properly disposed of and can potentially leak into 
                                                 the atmosphere and damage the ozone layer. When these appliances are
                                                  recycled, Freon and other chemicals are disposed of properly 
                                                  removing the hazard of damaging the atmosphere.
