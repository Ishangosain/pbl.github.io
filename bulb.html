        <p><font size="5"> 1)Things You Need:-For the vase: old light bulbs
            needle nose pliers
            nail set
            hammer</font></p>
             <p><font size="5"> 2)Breaking the back part of bulb:- use the nail set and hammer to break the 
                 black part of the bulb be careful, it is glass.</font></p>

                 <p><font size="5">3)Removing the Silver Layer of Bulb:- Removing the Silver Layer of Bulb
                    Remove the small silver layer with your pliers. Tap out black glass into garbage. 
                    Break the next layer of glass inside the bulb carefully, using the nail set and hammer
                     again. Break off any little pieces around the inside edge of the bulb. </font></p>

                <p><font size="5">4)Removing the guts of the Bulb:-
                    Remove the guts of the bulb with your needle nose pliers. Shake out any loose glass. 
                    You now have a vase.</font></p>

                 <p><font size="5">5)Stand/Hanger for the Bulb:-
                    Drill a 1 by 8 inch hole in the dowel or big enough for your wire to fit it in.Mike also
                     wrapped a few layers of electrical tape around the dowel because the dowel was not as 
                     big as the light bulb base. (You will also be able to adjust the size after removing the 
                     wire from the dowel). Cut your wire into 20cm pieces. Mike used the wire that you use to 
                     hang drop ceilings with. Put wire into the hole in the dowel and start wrapping the wire around the dowel clockwise. 
                    Wrap it 2-3 times.                  
                    Use the wire cutters to remove the wire from the dowel, cutting right at the hole. Check to see if your bulb will fit into coils, adjust if needed by turning the wire with pliers to either tighten or loosen.</font></p>

                     <p><font size="5">6)Hanging the Vase:-
                        Thread bulb into wire, it should thread in and tighten up - like putting a bulb in a
                         light socket. Bend wire down to form a base, shaping it how you like.
                         To make a hanging vase, follow the steps above for preparing the light bulb. 
                         Then drill two holes in the bulb base and attach floral wire.

                        Enjoy your new cute, upcycled vase! Have a happy day!</font></p>
