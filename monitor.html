        <p><font size="4.25">1)Gather Your Materials:-
            Materials
            An old CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) computer monitor
            Plexiglas (I use 1/8 inch)
            Two part epoxy
            Clear bathroom/kitchen grade silicone caulk
            Paint for the background of the tank
            Duck Tape
            Hot Glue
            Permanent markers
            Expanding insulation foam
            
            Tools
            Safety glasses or face shield
            Thick work gloves
            Hammer
            Screwdrivers
            Utility knife
            Rotary tool with cutting bit
            Pliers
            Speed square
            Measuring tape
            etc. ...whatever works
            </font></p>
             <p><font size="4.25">2) Removing the CRT:-
            
                I began by removing the old speakers attached to the side of the monitor by unscrewing two
                 bolts on each side. I then promptly plugged then into my ipod. They worked great giving me 
                 amplified music to work by.
                 Next I removed four screws that held together the plastic housing, opened it up, and removed 
                 the monitors guts...very interesting stuff. The Cathode Ray Tube its self was attached to the
                  very front of the plastic housing with four more metal screws that I, of course, removed 
                  (make sure you save all the mounting screws as you will need them later).</font></p>

                 <p><font size="4.25">3) Keeping the Curve.
                    WARNING - the Cathode Ray Tube is in vacuum. Breaking the tube can be VERY DANGEROUS. If you 
                    are to attempt this please be sure to wear proper safety gear (eye protection/face shield, gloves,
                     etc.).
                     When I began this I was really hoping to be able to simply cut/drill a hole in the top part 
                     of the CRT, clean out the inside, caulk the back where the cathode is, and then fill it with 
                     water. BOY WAS I WRONG. Long story short, there is a big metal screen inside the CRT and I 
                     cracked the glass beyond repair, but who knows maybe I will try again sometime now that I have 
                     gotten a better look at the inside of the CRT.
                    
                    Luckily, after my failed attempt at putting a fairly large hole in the CRT, the front of the tube
                     was still not cracked. So it was up to me and Mr. hammer to get rid of the excess glass.
                    
                    Once the excess glass has been removed you will need to remove the metal screen. Do not use a 
                    grinder to do this like I did. There are metal studs that go through the glass and using a grinder
                    cause the metal to expand and then the glass to crack. The metal screen can be removed by pressing
                     down and over on the screen support clips.
                    
                    Now that the metal screen is out the screen needs to be cleaned. I used some WD40 and an old 
                    t-shirt rag and it seemed to do the trick. Be careful the stuff on the screen flakes off a lot 
                    and is probably not very good to breath in, so wear a mask and turn your shop-vac on to catch as
                     much of the flake/dust as possible.
                    
                    Next I went a head and put some duct tape around the edge of the glass to soften the edge and keep
                     it from biting me. </font></p>

                <p><font size="4.25">4)Plexiglas Is Your Friend:-
                    Okay, so I decided to use the front of the glass CRT as the front of the fish tank and 
                    make the rest out of Plexiglas. Begin by measuring, measuring, and some more measuring. 
                    See what will fit inside your monitor.When cutting Plexi you can score it deeply with a utility knife and then snap of the pieces.
                    Once I had all the Plaxi pieces cut and ready, I layed all the pieces flat, mixed up a batch of two part
                     epoxy for plastics, and glued the three sides and the bottom together using a little duct tape to hold 
                     them in place while the glue set up.
                    </font></p>

                 <p><font size="4.25">5) Painting a Background:-
                    
                    I did not want to look at the dull gray plastic of the inside of a computer monitor, 
                    so the next step I did was to paint on the OUTSIDE of the Plexi fish tank.</font></p>

                     <p><font size="4.25">6) Access Panel:-
                        To make the access panel I used a rotary tool with cutting bit and carefully cut along 
                         edge of the top of the tank. This allowed it to be secured by slipping the, already present,
                          tabs under the front part of the plastic monitor housing.</font></p>

                         <p><font size="4.25">7) Attaching Plastic to Glass:-
                            After many test fits, I went ahead and mixed up a batch of two part multipurpose epoxy, spread it on 
                            the front edges of the plastic tank, as well as on the glass front, and then maneuvered the tank into
                             place. I then put a few pieces of scrap wood inside to push against the plastic in order to bow the
                              edges. This effectively curved the edges out to the edges of the monitor and then let it cure. While
                            the epoxy was setting up I added some hot glue around the outside of the tank in an effort to fill gaps and
                                to create a better fit.</font></p>
                         <p><font size="4.25">8) Fill-er-up:-
                            I felt it wise at this point to test fill the tank. Good thing too because it leaked!
                             Well I first tried hot glue.... It still leaked. Then, after searching my workshop, I found a partial
                              tube of clear bathroom/kitchen grade silicone caulk. This seemed to do the trick, of course if you 
                              happen to have a tube of aquarium sealant that would probably work better. After a few more test fills
                               and leak checks the tank was ready to be returned to the monitor housing.</font></p>
                         <p><font size="4.25">9) Lighting:-
                            For lighting I picked up a small fluorescent bulb that fits into a regular light bulb socket. Also, after 
                            searching the basement I found an old heat lamp that I could use for the fixture. To keep the light bulb 
                            from falling in the water I cut a small piece of 2 inch PVC pipe, cut a groove in it for the lights switch
                             to fit, sanded one side, and then used some super glue to glue it to the underside of the access panel. 
                             The power cord for the light goes out the back of the computer just like the monitor power cord normally
                              would. The tube for the bubbler worked in much the same way, with the tube coming out the back.</font></p>
                         <p><font size="4.25">10)Water Support:-                            
                            Begin by returning the tank to the monitor housing and securing it with the screws you originally removed. 
                            Next make sure your lighting and air lines are in place. At this time it would be a good idea to fill the 
                            rest of the computer housing outside the tank with expanding insulation foam. When it cures this will not
                             only insulate your new tank, but more importantly, it will support the weight of the water that the Plexi
                              is attempting to contain. My concern here is that if there is no support under the plastic tank it may 
                              rip away from the glass front. </font></p>
